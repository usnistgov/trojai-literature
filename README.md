      Summary
      </summary>  

      * Introduces first example of backdoor attacks against NLP models using Char-level, Word-level, and Sentence-level triggers (these different triggers operate on the level of their descriptor) 
        * Word-level trigger picks a word from the target model’s dictionary and uses it as a trigger
        * Char-level trigger uses insertion, deletion or replacement to modify a single character in a chosen word’s location (with respect to the sentence, for instance, at the start of each sentence) as the trigger.
        * Sentence-level trigger changes the grammar of the sentence and use this as the trigger
      * Authors impose an additional constraint that requires inserted triggers to not change the sentiment of text input
      * Proposed backdoor attack achieves 100% backdoor accuracy with only a drop of 0.18%, 1.26%, and 0.19% in the models utility, for the IMDB, Amazon, and Stanford Sentiment Treebank datasets

      Summary
      </summary>  

      * Authors introduce a run-time based trojan detection system called STRIP or STRong Intentional Pertubation which focuses on models in computer vision
      * STRIP works by intentionally perturbing incoming inputs (ie. by image blending) and then measuring entropy to determine whether the model is trojaned or not. Low entropy violates the input-dependance assumption for a clean model and thus indicates corruption 
      * Authors validate STRIPs efficacy on MNIST,CIFAR10, and GTSRB acheiveing false acceptance rates of below 1%

      Summary
      </summary>  

      * Authors develop SentiNet detection framework for locating universal attacks on neural networks
      * SentiNet is ambivalent to the attack vectors and uses model visualization / object detection techniques to extract potential attacks regions from the models input images.  The potential attacks regions are identified as being the parts that influence the prediction the most. After extraction, SentiNet applies these regions to benign inputs and uses the original model to analyze the output 
      * Authors stress test the SentiNet framework on three different types of attacks— data poisoning attacks, Trojan attacks, and adversarial patches. They are able to show that the framework achieves competitive metrics across all of the attacks  (average true positive rate of 96.22% and an average true negative rate of 95.36%)

      Summary
      </summary>  

      * Identified a  "spectral signatures" property of current backdoor attacks which allows the authors to use robust statistics to stop Trojan attacks 
      * The "spectral signature" refers to a change in the covariance spectrum of learned feature representations that is left after a network is attacked. This can be detected by using singular value decomposition (SVD). SVD is used to identify which examples to remove from the training set. After these examples are removed the model is retrained on the cleaned dataset and is no longer Trojaned. The authors test this method on the CIFAR 10 image dataset.

      Summary
      </summary>  

      * Proposes Activation Clustering approach to backdoor detection/ removal which analyzes the neural network activations for anomalies and works for both text and images
      * Activation Clustering uses dimensionality techniques (ICA, PCA) on the activations and then clusters them using k-means (k=2) along with a silhouette score metric to separate poisoned from clean clusters  
      * Shows that Activation Clustering is successful on three different image/datasets (MNIST, LISA, Rotten Tomatoes)  as well as in settings where multiple Trojans are inserted and classes are multi-modal

      </summary>  

      * Investigate two potential detection methods for backdoor attacks  (Fine-tuning and pruning). They find both are insufficient on their own and thus propose a combined detection method which they call "Fine-Pruning"  
      * Authors go on to show that on three backdoor techniques "Fine-Pruning" is able to eliminate or reduce Trojans on datasets in the traffic sign, speech, and face recognition domains

      Summary
      </summary>  

      * Introduce Trojan Attacks— a type of attack where an adversary can create a maliciously trained network (a backdoored neural network, or a BadNet) that has state-of-the-art performance on the user’s training and validation samples, but behaves badly on specific attacker-chosen inputs
      * Demonstrate backdoors in a more realistic scenario by creating a U.S. street sign classifier that identifies stop signs as speed limits when a special sticker is added to the stop sign
